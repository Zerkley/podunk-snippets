# podunk-snippets

This is a library of snippets for Flutter and Riverpod, following Hexagonal Architecture. It is tailored for the usecase of our company, Podunk Software, and as such it may not be usable or convenient for general users. Using the "Awesome Flutter Snippets" extension is recommended instead, as it is more generalistic.
